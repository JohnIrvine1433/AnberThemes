# ArkThemes

Theme installer for [ArkOS](https://github.com/christianhaitian/arkos)  
Tested on the RG351P and RGB10  

Adapted [AnberPorts](https://github.com/krishenriksen/AnberPorts) by [kreal](https://github.com/krishenriksen) to make a theme installer and updater. Currently only themes by [Jetup](https://github.com/Jetup13) are included.  
Thanks to **choo t** for the theme update script used to install/update the supported themes

## Regarding [JohnIrvine](https://github.com/JohnIrvine1433) ArkThemes Fork
Fork evolutions :
- Automatic theme collection management from GitHub repository (default set to Jetup13).
- Themes update management based on latest commit.
- Access theme description from install menu and latest commit message from update menu.
- ArkThemes version management.
- Advanced functions and settings (view theme change log, startup options, user defined themes collection)
- Various code optimisation

NOTA BENE :
- Themes are pulled from GitHub based on repositories starting with "es-theme"
- Beware that name duplicates (between different GitHub owner) is currently not managed ; this could lead to unwanted behaviour if you choose to swap between theme collections (e.g. replace a theme with another)
- Uninstaller allows removal of stock themes which cannot be reinstalled via ArkThemes.

## Installation  
Need to be on ArkOS 2021-02-13 (02132021) or newer.  
Place *ArkThemes.sh* and *ArkThemes* folder in `/roms/tools`
You can do this over your network, or by plugging the sdcard into your PC. In that case the location would be `EASYROMS/tools`.

Now in ArkOS Options menu there will be a folder called **Tools** and ArkThemes can be run from there.
